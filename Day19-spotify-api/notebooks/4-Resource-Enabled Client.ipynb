    "# Notes\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "* What would this API Client look like with normal Python `.py` files? Would we have it all in one big file or would we split it up a little over multiple, smaller files? Any rough sketch of what that may look like?\n",
    "* Could we have created a `BaseClient` class for the minimum parts (e.g., client authorization, etc.) and then create a `SpotifyAPIClient(BaseClient)` that inherits from this `BaseClient` for more generalized use? This way a `BaseClient` could be used/inherited inside multiple other API Clients?\n",
    "## Authorization\n",
    "* Need to use `client_id` and `client_secret` to retrieve a auth token that will allow us to interact with the Spotify API service.\n",
    "* Typically authenticate once, retrieve a token which is then attached to your session. During your current session you'll be able to interact/make multiple requests with the service. This allows you to not have to login every time to access your session.\n",
    "* Handy [Authorization Flow Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/) from Spotify. We are buidling a **client** to interact with Spotify's API. You have to authenticate how a *user* authenticates with your *client* **and** Spotify at the same time (advanced - not covered fully in this tutorial). We're only using the **Client Credentials** flow, which requires a `Client ID` and `Secret Key` and we'll get in return an `Access Token`. This approach won't give give access to manage private user data, just general data only.\n",
    "* Our **client** is the application we're building and it (the app) needs to request authorization by sending a `POST` request.\n",
    "* `base64` is a more secure string format. For non-Base 64 encoded strings, you generally can build something like `client_creds = f\"{client_id}:{client_secret}\"`. You can encode/decode \b\b`str` to bytes using `str.encode()` and `str.encode().decode()`. The Spotify backend API is going to take our base64 encoded `str` (not `bytes`) we pass and then `base64.base64decode()` to verify credentials. Steps to do this:\n",
    "    1. First take `str` and encode to `bytes` using `str.encode()`\n",
    "    2. Then encode this bytestring to base64 using `base64.b64encode(bytestring)`\n",
    "    3. Next, decode this base64 `bytes` so it's back to `str` using `client_creds_b64.decode()` (**not** `b64decode()`).\n",
    "* The token response data we get after making the `POST` request to authorize our client has the `access_token` and the `expires_in` (seconds) details. We can use `datetime` and the `timedelta(seconds=expires_in)` to create an easy `expires` `datetime.datetime` object for tracking. We can check whether our token expired and to fetch a new one: `did_expire: bool = expires < now`.\n",
    "## Base API Client Class\n",
    "* Once we have our `access_token` then we can use it. However, the `expires` and `access_tokens` are **state-like** items, so they will change over time. So, better would be to create a `BaseClient` **class** that can adjust/respond to these state changes in order to make our API calls through the class (and its methods) rather than just through simple functions like we did in `Auth.ipynb`. We're going to turn our functions into class methods.\n",
    "* Create our first class `SpotifyAPI(object)` with some general-purpose variables (nothing hard-coded since we want to reuse this for various sessions). We can pass the `client_id` and `client_secret` to the `__init__` function. The `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` allows us to call the class our class is inheriting from *directly*. Currently we're not doing that but in the future if we wanted to then having this line allows us to do that. \n",
    "* ?? We set `client_id` and `client_secret` to `None` by default for the class. However, we need to **update** them...?? Aren't these already available though since we set them inside the __init__ function? I think so but this makes it cleaner so we don't have to `{self.client_id}`? Not sure though as he mentioned \"updating\" these values...\n",
    "    * I *believe* we have to update the class variables within these methods because when we initialize/create a new instance of the class, we only pass in `client_id` and `client_secret` (based on our `__init__`). However, the other class variables (`access_token`, `expires`, etc.) are defaulted to `None` so our class methods need to update these values e.g, `self.access_token = access_token` (once we have retrieved the true `access_token`).\n",
    "* **Refactor** Could refactor the base class to have a method that handles the response data instead of all within the current `perform_authorization()` method.\n",
    "* **Refactor** Need to improve how we get the `access_token` because when it does expire, ideally it will go fetch another one automatically by re-performing this authorization function again.\n",
    "* Eventually going to take this base class and expand it to allow for something like `client.search` (`spotify.search`).\n",
    "## Use the Access Token\n",
    "* Following the [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) docs.\n",
    "* Once we get our `access_token` after `perform_authorization()`, the `token_type: \"bearer\"` instead of `Basic`. So, the initial `token_headers` header of `Authorization` had a `Basic` type. After we perform authorization, we receive `token_type: \"bearer\"`. This means we use `bearer` token moving forward.\n",
    "* We're essentially authorized to interact with the API via our new Client app. That means for each request we make to say, search for various songs or albums, we need to have this `bearer` token attached. Also, for Spotify specifically, we build up a request to query but we pass in all the `data` *directly* inside the `endpoint`/`lookup_url` we pass to `requests.get()`. \n",
    "    * To create this `lookup_url` string, we're going to use `from urllib.parse import urlencode` to help.\n",
    "* We now authenicated and worked with the API via our base class (client app). We have a working example of using the `search` endpoint of the API. However, we don't want to copy/paste the request code each time. Better would be to refactor/improve our `client`/`spotify` app (class) by adding some more helper/utility/convenience class methods to perform these searches, auto-refresh/fetch our `access_token` when it expires, and even allow accessing other endpoints (`artists`, `/v1/albums/{id}`, etc.). \n",
    "## Resource-Enabled Client\n",
    "* We now authenicated and worked with the API via our base class (client app). We have a working example of using the `search` endpoint of the API. However, we don't want to copy/paste the request code each time. Better would be to refactor/improve our `client`/`spotify` app (class) by adding some more helper/utility/convenience class methods to perform these searches, auto-refresh/fetch our `access_token` when it expires, and even allow accessing other endpoints (`artists`, `/v1/albums/{id}`, etc.). \n",
    "* Need to add a `get_access_token()` method and `search()` method. Our `perform_authorization()` method doesn't actually return the `access_token` -- it's currently just stored in `self.access_token` so better would be to create a new method specific to getting it and then using it within our authorization based on whether it was successfully retrieved.\n",
    "* Add an additional attribute to our class (client) e.g., `def get_album()`, `def get_artist()` etc. So far we're only using the `Search` endpoint provided by Spotify's API. There [are a lot of other](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/search/search/) endpoints such as `Albums`, `Artists` etc. we could access.\n",
    "* Since there is an obvious pattern to accessing the `Albums` and `Artists` endpoints, let's create another method `def get_resource()` that is a more generalized method where we can pass the `resource_type` (e.g., `album` or ` artist`) and the `_id`. \n",
    "* Again, each request we make must be authorized and once we're (our client) is authorized, we have to attach/add an `\"Authorization\": \"Bearer {access_token}\"` `header` within our `request`. Since this `header` is required for every request, better would be to refactor and create an additional helper/convenience method `get_resource_header` (or could be called `get_access_header`, etc.).\n",
    "* **Challenge** Could expand by making a sub-class (another object?) for artists and albums themselves so we can get even more data about them.\n"
