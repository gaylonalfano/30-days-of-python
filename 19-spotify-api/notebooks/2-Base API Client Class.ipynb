    "## Authorization\n",
    "* Need to use `client_id` and `client_secret` to retrieve a auth token that will allow us to interact with the Spotify API service.\n",
    "* Typically authenticate once, retrieve a token which is then attached to your session. During your current session you'll be able to interact/make multiple requests with the service. This allows you to not have to login every time to access your session.\n",
    "* Handy [Authorization Flow Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/) from Spotify. We are buidling a **client** to interact with Spotify's API. You have to authenticate how a *user* authenticates with your *client* **and** Spotify at the same time (advanced - not covered fully in this tutorial). We're only using the **Client Credentials** flow, which requires a `Client ID` and `Secret Key` and we'll get in return an `Access Token`. This approach won't give give access to manage private user data, just general data only.\n",
    "* Our **client** is the application we're building and it (the app) needs to request authorization by sending a `POST` request.\n",
    "* `base64` is a more secure string format. For non-Base 64 encoded strings, you generally can build something like `client_creds = f\"{client_id}:{client_secret}\"`. You can encode/decode \b\b`str` to bytes using `str.encode()` and `str.encode().decode()`. The Spotify backend API is going to take our base64 encoded `str` (not `bytes`) we pass and then `base64.base64decode()` to verify credentials. Steps to do this:\n",
    "    1. First take `str` and encode to `bytes` using `str.encode()`\n",
    "    2. Then encode this bytestring to base64 using `base64.b64encode(bytestring)`\n",
    "    3. Next, decode this base64 `bytes` so it's back to `str` using `client_creds_b64.decode()` (**not** `b64decode()`).\n",
    "* The token response data we get after making the `POST` request to authorize our client has the `access_token` and the `expires_in` (seconds) details. We can use `datetime` and the `timedelta(seconds=expires_in)` to create an easy `expires` `datetime.datetime` object for tracking. We can check whether our token expired and to fetch a new one: `did_expire: bool = expires < now`.\n",
    "## Base API Client Class\n",
    "* Once we have our `access_token` then we can use it. However, the `expires` and `access_tokens` are **state-like** items, so they will change over time. So, better would be to create a `BaseClient` **class** that can adjust/respond to these state changes in order to make our API calls through the class (and its methods) rather than just through simple functions like we did in `Auth.ipynb`. We're going to turn our functions into class methods.\n",
    "* Create our first class `SpotifyAPI(object)` with some general-purpose variables (nothing hard-coded since we want to reuse this for various sessions). We can pass the `client_id` and `client_secret` to the `__init__` function. The `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` allows us to call the class our class is inheriting from *directly*. Currently we're not doing that but in the future if we wanted to then having this line allows us to do that. \n",
    "* ?? We set `client_id` and `client_secret` to `None` by default for the class. However, we need to **update** them...?? Aren't these already available though since we set them inside the __init__ function? I think so but this makes it cleaner so we don't have to `{self.client_id}`? Not sure though as he mentioned \"updating\" these values...\n",
    "    * I *believe* we have to update the class variables within these methods because when we initialize/create a new instance of the class, we only pass in `client_id` and `client_secret` (based on our `__init__`). However, the other class variables (`access_token`, `expires`, etc.) are defaulted to `None` so our class methods need to update these values e.g, `self.access_token = access_token` (once we have retrieved the true `access_token`).\n",
    "* **Refactor** Could refactor the base class to have a method that handles the response data instead of all within the current `perform_authorization()` method.\n",
    "* **Refactor** Need to improve how we get the `access_token` because when it does expire, ideally it will go fetch another one automatically by re-performing this authorization function again.\n",
    "* Eventually going to take this base class and expand it to allow for something like `client.search` (`spotify.search`).\n",
